# Data Structures & Algorithms

## Data Structures
- Arrays
- Strings
- Hash Maps / Hash Sets
- Linked Lists (singly, doubly)
- Stacks
- Queues
- Deques
- Heaps / Priority Queues (min-heap, max-heap)
- Binary Search Trees (BST)
- General Binary Trees
- Tries (Prefix Trees)
- Graphs (Adjacency list / matrix)
- Grids (2D arrays, treated as graphs)
- Union-Find / Disjoint Set Union (DSU)
- Interval Lists
- Sliding Window structures
- Prefix Sum arrays
- Monotonic Stack / Monotonic Queue

## Algorithms & Techniques
- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Binary Search (on sorted array, on answer)
- Sorting (Merge Sort, Quick Sort ideas, custom comparator usage)
- Greedy algorithms
- Divide and Conquer
- Dynamic Programming (1D, 2D, subsequences, knapsack-style)
- Backtracking (DFS with state)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- Topological Sort (Kahn’s, DFS)
- Bellman-Ford (rare, but conceptually included)
- Union-Find algorithms (path compression + union by rank)
- Flood Fill
- Matrix traversal (DFS/BFS)
- Fast & Slow Pointers (linked lists, cycle detection)
- Kadane’s Algorithm (maximum subarray)
- KMP Algorithm (string matching)
- Trie-based search / word search
- Interval Scheduling / Merging Intervals
- Heap-based scheduling / median maintenance
- Bit Manipulation (XOR tricks, subsets, bitmask DP)
- Modular arithmetic (prefix sum mod tricks)
- Monotonic Stack (next greater element, largest rectangle in histogram)
- Monotonic Queue (sliding window maximum)
