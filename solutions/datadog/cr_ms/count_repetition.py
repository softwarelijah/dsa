"""
Given a paragraph (string), determine the total number of repeated words.
A word counts as repeated if it appears more than once. For each word,
the number of repetitions is (count - 1). Return the total repetitions. (IMPORTANT) 

Example 1:
Input: paragraph = "the lion eats other sheep and the lion then sleeps while the sheep eats"
Output: 5
Explanation:
- "the" appears 3 times → 2 repetitions
- "lion" appears 2 times → 1 repetition
- "eats" appears 2 times → 1 repetition
- "sheep" appears 2 times → 1 repetition
Total repetitions = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5

Constraints:
- 1 <= len(paragraph) <= 10^5
- Paragraph consists of lowercase and uppercase letters and spaces.
