Problem StatementProblem Statement: US Coin Change

You are given an integer array coins representing US coin denominations 
[1, 5, 10, 25] (penny, nickel, dime, quarter) and an integer amount 
representing a total amount of money in cents.

Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount 
using a greedy algorithm.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

Example 1:
Input: coins = [1, 5, 10, 25], amount = 63
Output: 6
Explanation: 63 = 25 + 25 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1

Example 2:
Input: coins = [1, 5, 10, 25], amount = 41
Output: 4
Explanation: 41 = 25 + 10 + 5 + 1

Example 3:
Input: coins = [1, 5, 10, 25], amount = 0
Output: 0
