Problem: Bucket Partition
-------------------------
Given an array of latencies, numBuckets, and bucketWidth:
- Create `numBuckets` number of buckets of length `bucketWidth`, starting at 0.
- Place each latency into its corresponding bucket based on its value.
- Any latency higher than the last bucket should be placed into the last bucket.
- Return an array `ans` of size numBuckets where ans[i] is the number of latencies in bucket i.

Example:
Input:
  latencies = [6, 7, 50, 100, 110]
  numBuckets = 8
  bucketWidth = 10
Output:
  [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2]
